### Features Layer in Feature-Sliced Design

The `features` layer is responsible for:

1. **Feature Components**: Defining components that encapsulate specific functionality or features.
2. **Business Logic**: Implementing the business logic related to the feature.
3. **State Management**: Managing the state specific to the feature.
4. **Data Access**: Handling data fetching and manipulation for the feature.
5. **Composition**: Combining multiple entities and shared components to create feature-specific functionality.

The `features` layer encapsulates distinct pieces of functionality, making them modular and reusable across different parts of the application.

A feature usually relates to a specific user interaction.

It is organized into separate slices which can contain segments belonging to the feature specific business domain.

│   │   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   ├── model/
│   │   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── config/
```

Entities can be used by `pages` and `widgets`.
