### Shared Layer in Feature-Sliced Design

The `shared` layer is responsible for:

1. **Utilities**: Providing utility functions and helpers that can be used across the application.
2. **Common Components**: Defining generic, reusable UI components that are not tied to specific features or entities.
3. **Constants**: Storing application-wide constants and configuration values.
4. **Services**: Offering common services that can be utilized by multiple layers.
5. **Types and Interfaces**: Defining common types and interfaces for type safety and consistency.

The `shared` layer contains generic, reusable code that promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and can be leveraged by other layers to maintain consistency and reduce duplication.

This layer is not organized in slices, it only holds segments:

```
src/
├── shared/
│   ├── ui/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── model/
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── config/
```
